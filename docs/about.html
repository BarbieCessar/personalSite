        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <div class="flex1">
            <div class="flexbox">
                <p> Hello! My real name is Barbara. I'm named after my Grandmother. I go by Barbie, but
                    my close friends and family call me Babz! I’m originally from Slippery Rock, PA.
                    I am the youngest child in my family. I have two older sisters and one older
                    brother. I also have a dog that I loved dearly named Caddie and she is an
                    English Setter. </p>
                <img src="images/fam2.jpg" class="image3" alt="photo" />
                <p>Being creative has been an outlet for me since I was very young. I have always
                    enjoyed drawing, painting, and making anything I could. When I graduated
                    highschool, I was looking for a major that I could still be creative in. I was
                    interested in Behrend’s Digital Arts, Media, and Technology (DIGIT) program
                    because I could still be creative through technology and learn more about
                    coding.</p>

        <p> I am highly involved here at Behrend. Outside of academics, I am captain of the Behrend Swim Team and President of the American
            Marketing Association. I have been competitively swimming since I was five years old. I
            started off doing almost every sport when I was younger and eventually focused solely on
            swimming when I went to college. Swimming has taught me a lot about perseverance, grit,
            and determination. Most of all I know what it’s like to work together with a team in
            order to achieve a goal. I also have experience with taking on a leadership role in both
            swimming and in my club. </p>

            <p> After being at Behrend for a while, I found myself looking into the business world.
                I then became interested in marketing because I could implement my designing skills
                in graphics and advertisements. After taking a few classes in marketing I realized
                my passion for data visualization. Therefore, I know the marketing side of things
                and I also know how to analyze what marketing techniques are productive and
                beneficial. I have enjoyed learning useful marketing tactics, coding, analyzing
                metric data, working with databases, creating useful visualizations, and designing
                flyers and advertisements during my years at Behrend. Over the years I’ve become
                proficient in using Adobe Photoshop, Oxygen XML Editor, Adobe Dream Weaver, Tableau,
                Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Hootsuite, and Canva. My
                vast skills in coding, designing, marketing, and data visualizations make me very
                unique and an asset to any future company. </p>
